# User Authorization

Sometimes it doesn't matter if you know who is who. Sometimes it doesn't matter, but you want to make sure people aren't voting again and again to game the system. Sometimes you want transparency. Maybe you already know who they are. Maybe you have your own authorization system. 

Polis handles all these cases. Here's how.

#### Optional social login

*DEFAULT* 

By default





There are multiple options for authorizing your participants. By default, users are prompted to connect to write and vote but do not have to. This is low friction usage and encourages activity in your conversations. Here are some other options:

Completely Anonymous - turn off social

Anon but verified

Social login to write

Social login to vote

Social login to write & vote

xid (is this the same as the data-yoursitecreds that we will do for times)
