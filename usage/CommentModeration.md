There is strict mode which means that no comments go out unless you have approved them to be shown, or lazy mode where are all comments go out and you can hide a comment after-the-fact. Polis has a built-in profanity filter you can turn on off, that will hide comments if they contain profanity.

To moderate comments:

`pol.is/m/5555555555 >> Comments >> TODO`

To turn on / off strict moderation:

`pol.is/m/5555555555 >> Config >> Strict Moderation`
