# Moderation

Strict mode: which means that no comments go out unless you have approved them to be shown. 

Lazy mode: all comments go out and you can hide a comment after-the-fact. 

Polis has a built-in profanity filter you can toggle on and off. The profanity filter will automatically moderate out comments that contain profanity.

To moderate comments:

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Comments >> TODO`

To turn on / off strict moderation:

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Config >> Strict Moderation`

To turn on / off profanity filter: 

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Config >> Profanity Filter`
