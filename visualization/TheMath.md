# The Math

You've probably seen 'recommended products' on Amazon, or 'recommended movies' on Netflix. Each of those services uses statistics to group you with people who buy and watch similar things, then show you things that those people bought or watched.

When you cast a vote on a comment, you are grouped with people who voted like you did! You can see those groups below. Each is made up of people who have similar opinions. There are fascinating insights to discover in each conversation. Go ahead - click a group to see what brought them together and what makes them unique.
