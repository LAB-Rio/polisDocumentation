Visualization: who gets shown

The visualization is potentially different for every user. There is a hierarchy of who get shown in the visualization. First we show a user's Facebook friends provided that you have connected to Facebook. After that we should people with a verified twitter accounts, then the people with the highest Twitter follower Count, and after that we fill in with random accounts from Facebook.

You can override this by featuring certain users in the admin panel, filtering people the same when you filter comments.
