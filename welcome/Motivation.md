polis was built in the interest of peace. how it could be said that this is true depends on our outlook on information.


# Motivation

Polis was conceived during the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. Both movements were decentralized and emergent. Twitter and Facebook proved instrumental in, mobilizing citizens, garnering media attention and disseminating information. They were not successful at producing coherence.

#### Coherence Without Centrality

The problems faced by the protestors in both cases are just an exaggerated, extreme form of the problem every organization over a few hundred people faces. There is a wonderful quote by Michel Foucault that captures it:

People know what they do
People frequently know why they do what they do
But no one knows what what they do does

This is the essence of

Smart policy is policy instructed by many quarters
