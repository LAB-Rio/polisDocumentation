Comments suck. Surveys suck. Here's the deeper story behind the creation of polis.

Polis was conceived during the Green Revolution in Iran, the Arab Spring, and Occupy Wall Street. These years, 2009-2011, showed the promise of digital democracy. They also bore out many of its shortcomings.

#### Coherence without centrality

Movements tend to delegate their authority to a central governing body. We'd like to prevent that. 

We're not anarchists. Yet we are in favor of radical transparency with regards to the opinions of the people. We believe that overcoming the agenda setting power of governments and media organizations is one of the most important information tasks of our generation. 

, but we're also taking democracy as an information problem. Ie., by changing the nature of how people can communicate and make decisions, you change the nature of discourse and decision making.
