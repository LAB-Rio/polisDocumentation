Polis is a new way to gather open ended feedback from scalably large groups of people. In plain english: if you’ve got lots of people, and they all write whatever they want and as much as they want in response to your question or stimulus (article, blog post, etc), it produces an unmanageable amount of data to sift through. Worse, if you do find an interesting point, you have no idea whether or not it represents the view of 90% of other people or 10%, information that is critical to making an informed decision on that feedback. This problem appears in both surveys, where users are asked to submit their own thoughts in an open text field, and in comment systems, which are effectively an open text field without the survey for people to write responses to an article.

Polis overcomes these hurdles by using a real-time system where users can submit comments and vote on comments submitted by others. The data produced by users voting on each others’ comments is processed using statistical algorithms. Polis can handle millions of participants and remain coherent (though it cannot similarly handle millions of comments - this would imply there are too many issues being discussed and the conversations should be broken up into several smaller topical conversations).
