# Overview

Polis is a new way to gather open ended feedback from large groups of people.

#### The problem with surveys and comments

Think of the comment field at the end of a survey, or the comment section at the end of a news article. Both allow participants to write down whatever they think. 

The first problem, of course, is that humans will need to process the massive amount of text that results. This creates a burden on both survey research teams and comment moderators, respectively. It is also impossible to discern whether a given viewpoint is representative of the crowd or not.

#### How polis is different

Polis overcomes these challenges and produces meaning from open ended responses. Participants can write what they think, but they can also agree and disagree with what others are saying. 

Polis runs statistical analysis on the voting patterns. It produces opinion groups and the comments that brought each group together. It also produces consensus. 

Polis scales to any number of participants, even millions. It accomplishes this by combining crowd behavior and machine learning. Humans can do what they are good at - reading text and forming snap judgments, as well as comparing statements. Computers can do what they are good at - finding patterns in large data sets.




In plain English: if you've got lots of people, and they all write whatever they want and as much as they want in response to your question or stimulus (article, blog post, etc), it produces an unmanageable amount of data to sift through. Worse, if you do find an interesting point, you have no idea whether or not it represents the view of 90% of other people or 10%, information that is critical to making an informed decision on that feedback. This problem appears in both surveys, where users are asked to submit their own thoughts in an open text field, and in comment systems, which are effectively an open text field without the survey for people to write responses to an article.

Polis overcomes these hurdles by using a real-time system where users can submit comments and vote on comments submitted by others. The data produced by users voting on each othersâ€™ comments is processed using statistical algorithms. Polis can handle millions of participants and remain coherent (though it cannot similarly handle millions of comments - this would imply there are too many issues being discussed and the conversations should be broken up into several smaller topical conversations).
